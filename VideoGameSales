##Im finding that the most games released were for the DS, PS2, and PS3. That makes sense considering these were the most popular systems during their respective times.

##If I wanted to make a video game what are the most popular genres and which have made the most money.

##The top three genres are Action, Sports and Role-Playing while the most grossing are Action, Sports and Shooter. I would recommend getting into the shooter genre as it seems it has the best ratio of games made to sales.
